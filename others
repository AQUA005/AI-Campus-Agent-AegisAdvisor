1. Data & Privacy Requirements (must-have)
FERPA-compliant: only authorized staff and the student can access educational records. Default: student data is private; external staff needs explicit authorization.
Consent model with scopes: READ_PROFILE, READ_TRANSCRIPT, WRITE_ENROLLMENT, SCHEDULE_MEETINGS.
Data retention policy and deletion request handling.
Encryption: AES-256 at rest; TLS1.2+ in transit.
Logging: immutable audit trail with student ID, action, timestamp, agent rationale summary, and human approver id (if any).
Minimization: only fetch fields required for a session, avoid persisting raw grades unless consented.
Differential privacy or aggregation for analytics when using historical outcomes.

2. Safety & Ethics: mandatory behaviors
Never change a student’s major, advisor, or official record without human approvals and a two-step confirmation.
High-risk or ambiguous scenarios (academic probation, academic integrity flags, administrative holds) → must route to a human advisor with suggested actions and a concise pack.
Provide clear opt-out and “talk to human” buttons prominently.
Explainability: every recommendation must come with the top-3 reasoning points (e.g., “satisfies requirement X; avoids time conflict; predicted success +0.2 GPA”).
Bias checks: test for systemic bias by demographic groups; expose mitigations.
Rate-limit automated enrollments and require explicit student consent per term.

3. Typical interaction flows (examples)
Student: “I want to graduate in 4 terms. Plan my next term.”
Agent: perceives transcript, requirements → reasons: constructs candidate course sets using constraint solver → acts: shows 3 schedules (fastest, balanced, lowest-workload) with trade-offs → student chooses one → agent offers to submit enrollment (if permitted).
Advisor: receives “Advising packet” for student with suggested exceptions (prereq waiver) + reasoning and simulation. Advisor approves or modifies.
High-risk flag: Student on probation tries to overload. Agent blocks auto-enroll and schedules an advisor meeting, sends resources for academic support.

4. Evaluation & Metrics
Accuracy: % of requirements correctly detected; correct course prerequisites handling — target >99% for canonical cases.
Satisfaction: student & advisor satisfaction surveys (NPS).
Time savings: avg. advisor time saved per case.
Correctness in enrollments: success rate of enrollment actions and rollback rate.
False escalation rate: % unnecessary human escalations.
Safety violations: zero unauthorized changes; detection via automated audits.
Fairness: statistical parity metrics across demographic slices.
Testing: unit tests for catalog parsing; integration tests with SIS sandbox; red-team policy violation tests; A/B trials with human oversight.

5. Failure Modes & Mitigations
Failure: wrong degree requirement mapping → Mitigation: cross-check mapping with Registrar canonical source; generate “confidence score” and require advisor sign-off below threshold.
Failure: enrollment API mistake → Mitigation: two-phase commit, dry-run + explicit user consent and undo capability.
Failure: data staleness → Mitigation: show last-updated timestamps; automatic re-fetch on sensitive actions.
Adversarial input: test harness and input sanitization.

6. Deployment & Ops
Deploy as microservices with containerized components (K8s).
Canary deploy on limited student cohort.
Observability: metrics (Prometheus), logs (ELK), SLOs with alerting.
Regular privacy and security audits.

CI/CD: tests including policy & red-team suites in pipeline.
