2. Needs perception (student records, calendar, course data), reasoning (degree mapping, prerequisite planning, trade-off analysis), and action (schedule proposals, registration API calls, calendar invites, advisor notifications).

3. Requires strong privacy, auditability, and human-in-the-loop governance — perfect to demonstrate safe, agentic AI design.
