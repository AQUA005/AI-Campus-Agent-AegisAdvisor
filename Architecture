a. Perception Layer
1. Connectors / adapters:
2. SIS (Student Information System) Connector (e.g., Banner, PeopleSoft, Workday Student) — read-only unless explicit action allowed.
3. LMS Connector (Canvas/Blackboard) for course metadata & grades.
4. Catalog API / Registrar feed.
5. Calendar & Email connectors.
6. Predictive analytics service (optional).
7. Data validation & canonicalizer (normalizes course codes, terms, section ids).

b. Knowledge & Memory
1. Short-term memory: session-level context + working plan.
2. Persistent memory (consented): preferences, declared constraints, advisor notes (encrypted).
3. Knowledge graph: students ↔ courses ↔ degree requirements ↔ policies (queryable).

c. Reasoning Layer
1. Rule Engine (formalized policy + degree requirements).
2. Planner/Constraint Solver (SMT/ILP or custom heuristic solver).
3. Ranking model (multi-objective scoring).
4. Explanation generator (maps solver steps to human-readable rationales).

d. Action Layer
1. Output renderers: UI cards, email templates, calendar invites.
2. Integration drivers: Enrollment API client, Meeting scheduler, Notification service.
3. Human-in-the-loop escalation workflow.

e. Governance & Safety
1. Consent manager (records scope of access and action).
2. Audit & Logging service (immutable logs).
3. Policy enforcer: prevents unauthorized actions and enforces hard constraints.
4. Privacy & encryption at-rest/in-transit; role-based access control.
5. Red-team testing harness & simulated adversarial inputs.

f. Interface
1. Student-facing UI (web/mobile/chat).
2. Advisor dashboard (approve/override recommendations; see audit trail).
3. Admin dashboard (metrics, errors, compliance).
